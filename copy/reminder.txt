Hey, it looks like to meet your goal this month, you should donate about $XXX. If you can donate more, awesome! You're changing lives. If you can't meet that exactly this month, don't worry, you can still donate what you can and make a huge difference. If you're looking for places to give money to, a few charities we love are [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org/), who are working to end hunger by giving the neediest families in the world animals that can support them in finding a better life, [Watsi](https://watsi.org/), which is currently funding life-saving medical treatment around the world, and [Water.org](http://water.org/), which provides access to clean water to people who don't even have that. Thanks so much for donating, and if you want to send us an email at [people@chari.co](mailto:people@chari.co), we think that would be dandy.
